## Projects completed as part of training at Yandex.Practice - Data Science Specialist

**Some completed projects in Yandex.Practice are presented:**

- ***Comments classification*** *(Project_Comments_classification)*

The task is to automate the assessment of the toxicity of comments in the community. Models SGDClassifier, RidgeClassifier, LogisticRegression were used. It was possible to get the value of the metric f1_score = 0.77 (the necessary condition is greater than 0.75). Tools used: NLTK, Pandas, numpy, sklearn.

- ***Determination of age by photo*** *(Project_Computer_Vision)*

The task is to determine the age of a person from a photograph. Tools used: Matplotlib, Pandas, Seaborn, keras.

- ***Forecasting taxi orders*** *(Project_Taxi_timeseries)*

The task is to train a model to predict the number of taxi orders for the next hour. LGBM and CatBoost models were built to predict the number of taxi orders for the next hour. It was possible to achieve the value of the RMSE = 44 metric (a necessary condition was to achieve a value less than 48) Used tools: CatBoost, LightGBM, Matplotlib, Pandas, StatsModels, numpy, sklearn.
